ðŸ”— Introduction to SQL JOINs

In real-world databases, data is often split across multiple tables to reduce redundancy and improve organization. To retrieve meaningful and complete information, we need to combine data from these related tables â€” and that's where **SQL JOINs** come into play.

SQL JOINs allow you to link rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, typically a primary key and foreign key relationship.

In this project, youâ€™ll explore and practice:
- **INNER JOIN** 
â€“ retrieves only matching rows from both tables

- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)** 
â€“ retrieves all rows from the left table and 
matching rows from the right table

- **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
â€“ retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table

- **FULL OUTER JOIN** 
â€“ retrieves all rows when there is a match in either table

- **CROSS JOIN** 
â€“ returns the Cartesian product of two tables
- **SELF JOIN** â€“ joins a table to itself

By understanding JOINs deeply, youâ€™ll be able to write efficient queries that connect complex datasets â€” a must-have skill for data analysis, backend development, and database design.
