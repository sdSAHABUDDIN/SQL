ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Filtering data is one of the most fundamental and powerful features of SQL. It allows us to extract meaningful insights by narrowing down large datasets based on specific conditions. This project focuses on practicing different types of SQL filtering techniques using real-world examples.

In this repository, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Use **comparison operators** to match specific values
- Apply **logical conditions** to combine multiple filters
- Use **range filtering** with `BETWEEN`
- Check **membership** using `IN` and `NOT IN`
- Perform **pattern matching** using `LIKE` and wildcards

Whether you're preparing for interviews or strengthening your database skills, this resource will help you build a solid foundation in data filtering using SQL.
