ðŸ§® Introduction to SQL Set Operations

Set operations in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries. These operations allow you to perform actions similar to mathematical set theory â€” such as unions, intersections, and differences â€” directly on database query results.

Set operations are especially useful when working with data spread across multiple tables or when comparing query results with similar structures.

In this project, youâ€™ll learn and practice the following SQL Set Operations:

- **UNION** 
â€“ Combines the result sets of two queries and removes duplicates  

- **UNION ALL** 
â€“ Combines the result sets of two queries, including duplicates  

- **INTERSECT** 
â€“ Returns only the rows that are common to both queries  
- **EXCEPT / MINUS** 
â€“ Returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second MySQL doesn't support `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`, but alternatives can be implemented using `JOIN` or `NOT EXISTS`

5> same order of columns
6> mapping correct columns
